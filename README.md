# MoviesRecommenderSystems
In this project we will use famous MovieLens dataset, which is one of the most common datasets used when implementing and testing recommender engines. It contains 100k movie ratings from 943 users and a selection of 1682 movies.

Firstly, we will focus on providing a basic recommendation system by suggesting items that are most similar to a particular item, in this case, movies. This is not a true robust recommendation system, it just tells you what movies/items are most similar to your movie choice.

Secondly, we will implement Memory-Based CF by computing cosine similarity.

Thirdly, we will implement Model-Based CF by using singular value decomposition (SVD).
